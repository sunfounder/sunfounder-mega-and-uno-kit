Projects
==============


The following projects are written in order of programming difficulty, so we recommend reading them in order.

In each project, there are very detailed steps to teach you how to build the circuit and how to program it step by step to achieve the final result.

Of course, if you want to open the script directly to run it, you can refer to :ref:`Download the Code` and we have uploaded all the code to github.

Once the download is complete, unzip it. Refer to :ref:`Stage Mode` to run individual scripts directly.

But the 11th project reads the temperature and humidity values in Upload mode, so please refer to :ref:`Upload Mode`.
