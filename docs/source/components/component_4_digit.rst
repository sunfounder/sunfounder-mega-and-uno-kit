4-Digit 7-Segment Display
==================================

4-Digit 7-segment display consists of four 7- segment displays working
together.

The 4-digtal 7-segment display works independently. It uses the
principle of human visual persistence to quickly display the characters
of each 7-segment in a loop to form continuous strings.

For example, when "1234" is displayed on the display, "1" is displayed
on the first 7-segment, and "234" is not displayed. After a period of
time, the second 7-segment shows "2", the 1st 3th 4th of 7-segment does
not show, and so on, the four digital display show in turn. This process
is very short (typically 5ms), and because of the optical afterglow
effect and the principle of visual residue, we can see four characters
at the same time.

**Display Codes**

To help you get to know how 7-segment displays(Common Anode) display
Numbers, we have drawn the following table. Numbers are the number 0-F
displayed on the 7-segment display; (DP) GFEDCBA refers to the
corresponding LED set to 0 or 1, For example, 11000000 means that DP and
G are set to 1, while others are set to 0. Therefore, the number 0 is
displayed on the 7-segment display, while HEX Code corresponds to
hexadecimal number.
